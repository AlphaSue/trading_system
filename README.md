# trading_system

This is my initial trading system. The running environment is python 3.5
Most of these code comes from they book <successful trading algorithm>. I just fixed part of bugs


## how to use

Before you run it you need to change the directory of your data.

To run the mac strategy, use "python mac.py"
To plot the performance, use "python plot_performance.py" to plot drawdown, Portfolio value, period returns
